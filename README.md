Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior computer engineering student at Erciyes University. I'm interested in algorithms & artificial intelligence since I started the college. I believe learning is a never-ending process and I have a passion to learn. Now trying to get some experience about android development, artificial intelligence and backend(.NET) technologies. My aim is to specialize more in my field and gain more experience in the following areas.
